# Architecture

## Unidentified intake boundary

Safely retained material without a unique identity, meaning, owner, or destination is
represented by one Core-owned Unidentified item per source occurrence or inseparable
submission group. It has an immutable `U<n>` reference, one canonical reason, and
open/resolved history. This is distinct from Triage, Blocked intake, Audit, Image
Intake, and formal Case/PO identity; existing architecture notes that describe the
former broad `Needs sorting` destination are historical compatibility descriptions and
must not be used as current operator vocabulary.

> This file is the current **as-built snapshot**: what components exist and how the running system is wired *now*. It is not the owner of rules. Product intent and invariants live in the [PRD](prd/pegasus-product.md) and [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#product-invariants); required behaviour in the [FRDs](frd/README.md); durable technical decisions in the [ADRs](adr/README.md); repository governance in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md); deployed/runtime state and dated evidence in [operations](operations.md); the schedule and capability IDs in [capabilities](capabilities.md). Where this file describes a rule, it is reporting how the system is wired, not competing with those owners. **Keep it current: after any deployment or release, update this file (and [operations](operations.md)) to match reality in the same task.**

This document is the canonical owner for the current system architecture, caller evidence, dependency direction, and application boundaries. Requirements, capability scope, unresolved decisions, operations, and historical decisions remain with their respective canonical owners.

Implementation, caller proof, deployment, and acceptance are distinct:

- **Intended** describes an approved or proposed design.
- **Implemented** means code exists.
- **Caller-proved** means a real entry point executes that code.
- **Deployed** means the relevant application and infrastructure are running in the named environment.
- **Accepted** requires the applicable technical, security, operational, and operator evidence.

Registration, tests, migration presence, generated infrastructure, predecessor behavior, and source imports do not by themselves prove a caller, deployment, authority, or acceptance.

## System shape

Pegasus is a seven-project modular monolith, including the native desktop client:

```

The current repository exposes an ASP.NET Core Razor Pages host, a .NET 10 isolated Azure Functions Worker, and a packaged .NET 10 WinUI 3 desktop client with a separate infrastructure boundary. The Worker has timer and queue-trigger callers that translate bounded work into Core use cases. The desktop infrastructure owns the gateway HTTP pipeline, per-user credential protection, bounded in-memory snapshots, and bounded redacted diagnostics; it has no database or provider credentials. Any provider API caller remains separately gated. The desktop composition root builds one generic host with embedded base plus build-time channel configuration (`local`, `pilot`, or `production`) before creating the WinUI window, and disposes that host when the application exits. The Automation MCP ingress is implemented inside `Pegasus.Web` behind a composition gate that is off by default; when the gate is off no automation route exists, and live activation remains separately approved.

The repository identifies its package and release target as `0.1.0-alpha.1`. Pegasus is deployed to its sole production environment by exact-SHA fast-forward releases of `main`; the current production state (release, revision, migration head, gate settings) is owned exclusively by [operations § Production environment](operations.md#production-environment) and is not restated here. Operator acceptance remains outstanding.

## Components and dependency direction

| Component | Ownership and permitted dependencies |
| --- | --- |
| `src/Pegasus.Core/` | Business use cases, invariants, models, decisions, and ports. It must not depend on Web, Worker, Infrastructure, EF Core, Azure, Graph, Box, or other adapter implementations. |
| `src/Pegasus.Contracts/` | Dependency-free shared request, response, problem-details, paging, concurrency, operation-key, compatibility DTOs, and operator vocabulary for the gateway and desktop. It depends only on the .NET base class library. |
| `src/Pegasus.Desktop/` | Packaged WinUI 3 presentation client (`net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0`, x64, self-contained). It may depend on Core, Contracts, and `Pegasus.Desktop.Infrastructure`; it must not depend on server Infrastructure, EF Core, Azure, Graph, Box, or Web. |
| `src/Pegasus.Desktop.Infrastructure/` | Desktop-only gateway HTTP pipeline, DPAPI credential store, bounded in-memory snapshot cache, and bounded redacted diagnostics writer (`net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0`). It references only Core and Contracts; it must not depend on server Infrastructure, EF Core, Azure, Graph, Box, or Web. |
| `src/Pegasus.Core/ReferenceData/` | Exact provider/domain-suffix package validation, deterministic candidate semantics, and the catalog port. It contains no workbook, package-file, or EF implementation. |
| `src/Pegasus.Infrastructure/` | EF persistence and source, artifact, package, and future external-system adapters implementing Core ports. It depends on Core. |
| `src/Pegasus.Web/` | Razor Pages and HTTP composition root, request translation, configuration, route gates, and health endpoints. It invokes Core through configured ports and Infrastructure adapters. |
| `src/Pegasus.Worker/` | Isolated Functions composition root. Its timer and queue triggers translate persisted intake, external-work, mailbox, sent-evidence, and reconciliation signals into Core use cases; it contains no duplicate business policy. |

Web and Worker may translate transport, identity, and configuration. They must not reproduce business policy. Infrastructure may implement Core ports but does not own business decisions. Core-typed Web label calls use the thin `Pegasus.Web.Presentation.OperatorLabels` adapter; the words and persisted-code maps are owned by `Pegasus.Contracts.Vocabulary.OperatorVocabulary` so the desktop and gateway share one vocabulary without a Core dependency.

A new project, runtime, store, migration stream, deployment unit, or top-level application boundary requires an accepted ADR demonstrating that these owners cannot carry the change. Decision status and supersession are maintained in the [decision index](adr/README.md).

## Architecture invariants

These invariants — `Pegasus.Core` is the single owner of business policy;
duplicate business implementation is a stop condition; a new top-level project,
store, runtime, migration stream, or deployment unit requires an accepted ADR
proving the existing boundary cannot carry it; and `Audit`, `Triage`, and
`Blocked intake` keep their settled distinct meanings, with `Unidentified`
superseding `Needs sorting` for that meaning — are owned by
[AGENTS.md § Product invariants](../AGENTS.md#product-invariants). This
section reports how the running system is wired to them; it does not restate or
compete with that owner.

Two current engineering conventions are not yet stated in AGENTS.md and remain
in force here:

- Do not introduce horizontal `Common`, `Helpers`, `Utilities` packages or
  version-suffixed names such as `V2`, `New`, or `Manager`.
- Classifier and extraction precedence must be explicit, ordered, documented,
  and covered by contradiction tests. External clients and catch paths
  distinguish `terminal`, `transient`, and `unknown`; terminal outcomes stop
  retries, unknown outcomes remain unknown, and metrics count successful effects
  rather than attempts.

## Current callers and entry points

### Staff Web callers

- Staff Razor Pages resolve request claims through the metadata-free
  `StaffPageModel`, which is the Web-owned adapter to Core
  `StaffActorFactory` and the shared operation-key generator. Administration,
  case-mutation, upload-confirmation, and direct staff page models inherit it;
  endpoint authorization remains on concrete pages or the authenticated
  fallback policy. Anonymous `/Uploads/{token}` remains outside this inheritance
  tree and reuses only the static operation-key generator. Manual upload receipt
  tokens remain a separate intake replay identity.
- `GET /Inbox` calls Core `ListRetainedMail` and `GetRetainedMailFreshness` for the mail workspace: retained messages newest first, scoped by mailbox and folder through the query string alone, with an explicit manual refresh that carries that scope; it is read-only and the page carries no handler. Its optional search filters retained mail in SQL before paging across the retained body, attachment filenames, and receipt-owned `IntakeSearchDocuments` projected atomically from the canonical intake-reader output. Deleted Items search instead calls Core `SearchDeletedMail`, which caps a request at the 100 newest messages and uses GET-only Graph reads against each exact approved mailbox and its resolved `deleteditems` folder; MIME is parsed once by the same intake reader and is neither retained nor backfilled. The durable queued-intake caller also applies MAIL-09's advisory association after evaluation: it derives candidates from current non-archived Case registration data and exact mailbox/conversation current associations, then delegates a fresh evidence fingerprint to the existing serializable, idempotent association transaction. `GET /Inbox/{id}` calls `GetRetainedMail` for one retained message, its attachments, its retained-scope thread, current classification, queue, processing outcome, current manual-or-accepted case association and latest folder-move result. For an unassociated exact receipt it also uses the canonical Case search/detail queries to show a searched business summary; the confirmed link POST re-resolves the message and receipt, verifies reviewed versions, acquires the existing Case edit lease and delegates to `ILinkIntake`. The confirmed unlink POST applies the same server-bound checks to the exact current Case and delegates to `IReverseIntakeLink`; replacement is a later independent search and link, not an active-to-active swap. That read also derives zero or one concrete suggested Move from the current folder recommendation and move eligibility; the advice is not stored and the page delegates its control to the existing confirmed move handler. `OnPostCorrectClassificationAsync` corrects classification. `OnPostMoveToRecommendedFolderAsync` accepts only the internal message id, current classification/recommendation/mailbox versions, operation key and required reason; Core revalidates the exact approved binding and Infrastructure reserves one `RetainedMailFolderMoves` record before the narrow provider port. A successful record overlays current location so the immutable arrival row remains unchanged and Inbox queries exclude the moved message. The provider is unavailable by default and the control is absent in that composition; fake-HTTP/local-SQL tests supply it, while no production writer, Graph permission, deployment or live mailbox mutation is active. The Web runtime role holds `SELECT` alone on the retained-mail and receipt search-projection tables and `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE` on the move-operation table; the Worker projection writer holds `SELECT, INSERT, DELETE` on `IntakeSearchDocuments` because replacement removes and recreates rows rather than updating them. Web also holds `SELECT, UPDATE` on `IntakeMailClassificationDecisions` and `SELECT, INSERT` on `IntakeMailClassificationHistory` (`UPDATE, DELETE` denied there).
- `GET /Operations` calls the Core Operations projection for retryable external work and active unexpired Pegasus-generated upload links. It has no approval controls, general receipt ledger, manual/email/Automation receipt display, or Box request caller. The separately planned principal-scoped provider API is not inferred from the Automation/MCP ingress. `GET /Received/{id}` calls `GetIntake`, and its retained receipt mutations call the named Core intake commands with a server-derived actor, expected versions or case lease, operation key, and reason as applicable.
- `GET /Received/{id}/Source` calls Core `DownloadIntakeSource`, which authorises the current staff actor, resolves the receipt-owned source, validates retained length and SHA-256, and returns only a no-sniff attachment with a safe filename and content type.
- `GET /VehicleImages` calls Core `IImageIntakeQueries` for the association-filtered image-intake receipt list and the exact Image Intake Reference lookup. `GET /VehicleImages/{id}` calls the same detail query plus the receipt's VRM suggestions and, while the record holds no case association, the registration-matched eligible-case candidates; both are read-only authenticated staff pages.
- `/Triage` and `/Triage/{id}` are the physical list/detail owners for Core triage queries and commands. The former Development web evaluator is not an application caller; the separately owned desktop evaluator remains outside the Web runtime.
- Anonymous request submission exists only at `/Uploads/{token}`. The PageModel calls `GetRequestUpload` and one `UploadToRequest` command, uses antiforgery and an idempotent operation key, and presents generic non-disclosing outcomes through PRG.
- The Case documents surface links confirmed custody directly to the case's real
  Box folder. The superseded internal Box File Request create/revoke mechanism
  has no caller or persistence model; request-scoped public upload links remain
  the separate INT-31 capability.
- These callers are source-state evidence; deployment state is owned by [operations § Production environment](operations.md#production-environment). Caller evidence alone does not establish browser accessibility acceptance or operator acceptance.

### Technical entry points

- `/health/live` reports liveness.
- `/health/ready` invokes the registered database health check.
- `/api/v1` is the versioned native-desktop gateway route group. It is
  composed only when `Features:DesktopGateway` is enabled; when the flag is
  absent or false, no `/api/v1` route is mapped. The group currently provides
  the shared correlation and problem-details boundary for later endpoint
  tickets; authentication and endpoint capabilities are added by those
  tickets.
- These endpoints are technical probes, not evidence of a product mutation or external integration.

### Worker callers

`src/Pegasus.Worker/Program.cs` constructs the Functions host. The concrete functions in `IntakeFunctions.cs`, `MailboxFunctions.cs`, `EmailEvidenceFunctions.cs`, and `Functions/ExternalWorkFunctions.cs` are the caller evidence for their timer and queue paths. Registration and host startup alone remain insufficient evidence of external-system activation or operator acceptance.

A Worker `local.settings.json` is unnecessary at this baseline. Copy `src/Pegasus.Worker/local.settings.example.json` to the ignored `local.settings.json` only when an actual trigger requires local Functions storage.

### Implemented production targets and absent callers

Worker production composition registers bounded Graph Inbox/Sent, Box
custody, and DVLA/DVSA adapters plus Azure Blob/queue transport. These are
**Deployed**, but deployment is not current execution evidence: the production
Worker is enabled, and its live runtime and estate state are owned by
[operations § Production environment](operations.md#production-environment).
Graph Inbox/Sent processing was live-verified for release
1; that historical proof does not establish the current retained-mail or
administrator-estate path. Exact current state is owned by
[operations § Production environment](operations.md#production-environment),
and operator acceptance remains outstanding.

Web production composition registers Box-backed case custody and managed
document content, the staff document and EVA handoff surface, and Azure Blob
intake artifact stores behind one storage profile. These are **Deployed**
(release 3); the current production state is owned by
[operations § Production environment](operations.md#production-environment).

In-process ONNX vehicle-registration recognition (ADR-0019) is implemented
in `src/Pegasus.Infrastructure/Vision/` behind the Core `ImageIntake`
automation; [operations § dated evidence](operations.md#dated-evidence-qualifications) owns the accepted evaluation numbers.
Implementation is not live-caller acceptance.

The following remain planned or absent, not merely unverified:

- broad Graph mailbox categorisation or any Graph mutation;
- Document Intelligence OCR;
- automated legacy DOC and MSG extraction;
- EVA export;
- provider API, which is deferred to the exact target owned by the [capability inventory](capabilities.md);
- live activation of the vendor-neutral Automation MCP: the ingress, actor contract, and tools are implemented but composition-gated off outside DevelopmentOffline evidence runs, non-blocking for `0.1.0-alpha.1`;
- correlated live telemetry, **for most of each day**. Both hosts are now
  instrumented: the Worker has reported continuously throughout the retained
  window, and release 19 instrumented the Web host, which had carried the
  connection string since the estate was built while never calling
  `AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry`. What is not solved is retention of that
  signal. The workspace runs a **0.1 GB daily quota resetting at 03:00Z**
  (`workspaceCapping.dataIngestionStatus: RespectQuota`) and the estate exhausts
  it within hours, so ingestion stops for the rest of the day and every check run
  in a UK working hour returns empty. That is not a hypothesis: it is why both
  production custody failures left no trace, and why release 20's cause had to be
  found by reading `sys.database_permissions` rather than a stack trace. The two
  alert rules cannot fire on the capped window either. Sampling is on
  (`APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_ENABLEADAPTIVESAMPLING`) and the Worker's own polling
  produces most of the volume, so measuring before buying quota is the cheaper
  order. Correlation, retention and alert delivery remain unproved until the
  window covers a working day (PLAT-034, open).
- an implemented automated check that composition-root persistence writes remain covered by
   the runtime-role grant catalogue. The architecture suite now derives registered
   EF stores (including concrete stores resolved by their registered factory interfaces),
   their EF `IModel` entity/table mappings, and detected INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE writes,
   then compares them with the two grant shapes accepted by
   `scripts/Test-MigrationGrants.ps1`. It also reconstructs the three shipped
   missing-write regressions — `20260814092852`, `20260821095500` and
   `20260822044425` — and carries a forward ungranted-table fixture. The static
   migration-grant script remains unchanged; full-privilege tests and LocalDB runs
   therefore no longer provide the only signal for this boundary (PLAT-035,
   automated coverage added).

## Current intake and extraction boundary

The locally verified slice includes provider-neutral intake, one concrete QDOS
extraction policy, and bounded production adapter implementations. It does not
prove deployed mailbox automation, live production custody/enrichment, the
full MVP, a second provider, or operator acceptance.

This is implementation evidence toward [INT-01, INT-08–13, INT-18–20, and INT-23](capabilities.md); the inventory owns allocation only, and each broader capability contract remains unproved.

### Accepted local inputs

The PageModel accepts one file no larger than 10 MiB with one of these extensions:

- `.eml`
- `.pdf`
- `.docx`
- `.doc`
- `.msg`
- `.jpg`
- `.jpeg`
- `.png`

One manual upload occurrence is identified by an opaque receipt token generated by the page.

The current enforced resource limits are:

| Boundary | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| ASP.NET Core multipart request | 10 MiB file allowance plus 64 KiB for the multipart envelope |
| PageModel file | One file; 10 MiB |
| Received mailbox message | One message, envelope and attachments together; 750 MiB |
| PDF reader | 5,242,880 extracted characters; 512 discrete image objects; 100,000,000 decoded image-sample pixels; 25 MiB extracted image bytes; 30 seconds |
| EML reader | Eight nested-message levels; 128 MIME entities; 25 MiB cumulatively decoded MIME bytes |
| DOCX reader | 512 package entries; 50 MiB total uncompressed bytes; 10 MiB for each XML or relationship part; 25 MiB total image bytes |
| DOC reader | 10 MiB input; 16,777,216 extracted characters; 1,000,000 piece-table pieces; the compound-file bounds below |
| MSG reader | Eight nested-message levels; the compound-file bounds below |
| Compound-file container (DOC and MSG) | 16 MiB input; 32,768 sectors; 131,072 directory entries; 16 MiB per stream; 64 MiB total stream bytes |

The multipart boundary is enforced before Core. Reader-limit outcomes remain visible and cannot allocate a case or reference.

A received message and an uploaded file are bounded separately. The upload figure bounds one file arriving in one HTTP request; an instruction email carries the covering message plus the documents and photographs of the job, and the two shared one figure until a 16.7 MB QDOS instruction was refused unread on 2026-08-05. The mailbox figure is permissive by intent rather than a capacity claim: the reader limits above still apply to what it admits, the poll materialises a message in memory, and no mail transport carries anything near it — the practical ceiling is set by the Worker instance.

### Source reading and retained evidence

The current reader can:

- read email bodies and bounded nested EML;
- enumerate supported attachments;
- read PDF embedded text and discrete image streams;
- read DOCX text and internal images;
- read legacy DOC (Word binary) text through the bounded compound-file and
  piece-table readers;
- read Outlook MSG bodies (plain, HTML, and compressed RTF), sender/subject
  transport evidence, and attachments, which re-enter the same dispatch so a
  PDF inside a message reaches the PDF reader;
- retain the uploaded source and each supported attachment, inline image, DOCX image, and discrete PDF image as separate review occurrences.

SQL stores metadata and opaque artifact keys, not file bytes.

Legacy DOC and MSG are extracted in-process since release 14 by the
CollisionDocNet-derived readers under `Pegasus.Infrastructure` (SIMPLI-013,
[ADR-0025](adr/0025-integrate-renderer-and-extractor-into-the-application.md));
unreadable, encrypted, or over-limit containers fail closed into Unidentified
without a reference. Ordinary images are retained review evidence; they are scanned by the in-process ONNX VRM engine (ADR-0019) and are never sent to an external OCR or vision service.

For PDFs, only low-text pages with a dominant raster are marked as scan-like OCR candidates. No OCR service is currently called. Document- and attachment-level OCR-required state is visible during review.

The reader constructs no network client, launches no process, and does not retrieve external links, images, relationships, keys, or other remote content. Graph, Box, Blob, OCR, DVLA/DVSA, EVA, workspace extractors, and any other external service remain outside the reader; bounded production adapters attach only at the Web and Worker composition roots.

### QDOS applicability and drafts

QDOS is the sole concrete extraction policy until another principal has approved rules and genuine evidence. It is applied only to fully readable input.

- Positive instruction content is required; QDOS is not a fallback principal.
- Strong instruction content may outrank a weak transport signal such as a staff-forwarding sender.
- A QDOS-looking sender or filename alone creates neither a draft nor a principal suggestion.
- The review surface shows classification evidence, ten field suggestions, missing values, conflicts, page-labelled extracted text, OCR-required state, and failure details.
- The typed instruction-draft values are read-only on the review surface. They are editable in one place, the create screen; original candidates and provenance stay visible beside every box. A value a person keys becomes a candidate of its own, sourced to the staff correction, so the case records who said it. Review does not withhold a definitive instruction's Case/PO allocation.
- An absent instruction date defaults from the receipt clock.
- The test clock is fixed to 2031, so integration assertions use a 2031 default instruction date.

Suggestions and typed drafts are neither editable nor approved case records. Receipt and extraction create no case, counter, year-based reference, or external categorisation.

**Definitive authorised intake attempts typed case allocation at processing time.** QDOS classification persists `Inspection`, `Audit`, or `Inspection + Audit` beside its policy version. With no definitive existing-case match, the durable processing path calls the Core `IAllocateIntake` owner for a `CaseCreated` processing decision and consumes only that persisted type and the extracted principal. The case enters `Not ready` with nothing confirmed by a person, because thin ordinary detail is never a reason to withhold the reference. The evaluation-scoped automatic attempt and its outcome are durable and replay-safe. A failed attempt leaves the completed receipt and a bounded operator-safe failure; completed-work replay cannot call acceptance again. Only an authenticated, reasoned staff retry can reuse the frozen failed command.

Only an **ambiguous** case match is withheld from automatic allocation. An Audit is definitive only where the retained email contains its instruction and a separate original report carrying one literal outcome, `repairable` or `total loss`; that creates its `a.` or `ap.` reference automatically without a staff confirmation. Missing, conflicting, or unclear Audit evidence is `Needs sorting`. A missing or disabled Principal is instead a visible recoverable allocation failure on the completed receipt. The create screen (`INT-26`) records detail and settles the inspection address. `EfCaseAcceptanceStore` still applies `IntakeDecisionPolicy.CanBecomeCase` inside the transaction, so eligibility does not depend on which caller asks, while actual success is projected only from the Case intake link.

### Idempotency and persisted semantics

- Replaying the same source occurrence returns the existing receipt.
- Equal source bytes under a different occurrence identity remain separate evidence.
- Stable decision, channel, evidence, and asset codes plus versioned JSON envelopes are persisted instead of CLR enum names.
- Unknown persisted codes and inconsistent policy results fail rather than being silently reinterpreted.
- `Needs sorting` and `Blocked intake` counts and filtered queues are persisted and queryable, and both exclude receipts that have produced a case, so they measure what is still waiting for a person rather than everything ever received. A `case_created` decision is not case-existence authority. Operations, retained Mail, Upload, MCP, and retry surfaces join the current allocation state and actual Case link.

## Business-rule ownership

Core owns:

- intake decisions;
- transport-normalised evidence passed into routing;
- route-policy selection;
- provider, type, principal, and case determinations;
- case and reference invariants;
- lifecycle, matching, and classification;
- shared business actions later exposed through Web, Worker, provider API, or MCP;
- exact provider/domain package validation and deterministic catalog outcomes.

Shared intake code may normalize transport, reconstruct one original sender
where a staff forward is proved (from an attached email or the strict ordered
Outlook `From:`, `Sent:`, `To:`, `Subject:` header quartet), extract subject,
body, attachments, and assets, invoke exactly one applicable route policy, and
record that policy’s evidence and version. It does not impose a universal
case-matching precedence. Partial, conflicting, or malformed forwarding
evidence remains reviewable rather than becoming route identity.

Direct-provider and intermediary policies are separate, code-versioned owners. They may identify the same provider, but each policy applies only to its own message shape and evidence.

The following invariants remain in force even where their activating callers are deferred:

- no case deletion;
- no reference reuse;
- no mutation of the principal after allocation;
- no second meaning for Audit, Triage, or Blocked intake, and none for
  `Unidentified`, which supersedes the former `Needs sorting` meaning;
- no case or reference allocation until configured principal identity, durable custody, and the accepted allocation transaction are available.

No rule engine may be copied into Web, Worker, a workspace, or an integration adapter.

## Provider/domain-suffix package boundary

The accepted package increment is based on revision `d0965e1264dadc8d9942ac54fd68a4b45fd06f28`; exact repository head must be verified before relying on file locations or test counts. The Pegasus identity cutover occurred at `f69ea31dfdf0a59b8a2c176da90ae22a538fbc9c`.

The immutable package has these qualifications:

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Package identity | `provider-domains-v1` |
| Package version | `0.1.0-alpha.1` |
| Schema version | `1` |
| Providers | `11` |
| Provider/intermediary domain-suffix associations | `16` |
| SHA-256 | `f6b5ad8ecdd428db4316b23e16aa7e0ffc93562aec33374c03ea68cd4f0370a3` |
| Current logical resource | `Pegasus.Infrastructure.Persistence.ReferenceData.provider-domains.v1.json` |
| Pre-cutover logical resource | `CollisionSpike.Infrastructure.Persistence.ReferenceData.provider-domains.v1.json` |
| Immutable source provenance | `docs/reference/workproviders-and-repairers/initial.xlsx` |
| Current physical authoring source | `reference/workproviders-and-repairers/initial.xlsx` (mapped only by authoring and test resolution) |

Core validates exact package tuples and defines deterministic results:

- `Found`
- `Unknown`
- `Ambiguous`
- `InvalidSuffix`
- `PackageNotFound`
- `PackageRejected`

Infrastructure implements the catalog through one bounded EF query against the requested immutable package version. A committed migration seeds the versioned, cumulative SQL snapshot from the validated embedded package.

A stored suffix is candidate evidence only. It does not:

- activate a route;
- authenticate or resolve a principal by itself;
- create an inspection location or default;
- map a Case ID;
- prove provider acceptance.

No Web or Worker caller currently consumes the catalog. Package presence, migration registration, and passing tests do not constitute route activation or operator acceptance. Neither Web nor Worker may parse the workbook or package directly.

## Data and custody boundaries

### Current Development data

`DevelopmentOffline` uses the platform's supported SQL Server — SQL Server Express LocalDB on Windows, a per-run container on Linux — through connection name `Pegasus`, database `PegasusDevelopment`, and the committed SQL Server migration stream. Deployed Pegasus uses Azure SQL through that SQL Server migration stream; there is no supported database-provider choice.

Current source and extracted bytes are retained under the ignored content-addressed root:

```text
artifacts/local-development/default/intake
```

This is local development evidence, not production Blob staging, Box custody, backup, or accepted recovery.

There is no supported non-Development filesystem fallback: outside the DevelopmentOffline profile, intake artifacts live in Azure Blob, never on the local filesystem. The staff `/Received/{id}`, `/Received/{id}/Source`, and `/Inbox` routes are served wherever intake is composed, including the Production runtime profile (composition merged; deployed state is owned by [operations § Production environment](operations.md#production-environment)), and return `404` everywhere else. The current artifact port exposes store and read operations only; Pegasus has no receipt/artifact deletion API, backup command, or proved restore path. Test-harness cleanup and manual removal of an owned ignored run directory are not application deletion or recovery evidence.

The application retains the original source before recording a reviewable receipt:

- retention failure is retryable and stores no receipt;
- a later SQL failure may leave reusable content-addressed bytes;
- those bytes must not be mistaken for an accepted receipt or production custody.

Sequential receipt-token/content conflicts are rejected before artifact storage. A simultaneous first-use collision can leave the losing hash unreferenced in ignored local storage. Production custody must close that race before activation.

### Target ownership

| Data or evidence | Intended authority |
| --- | --- |
| Case workflow, identity, configuration, permanent action history, and source/file relationships | Azure SQL |
| Long-term original-file custody | Box |
| Mailbox content and exact sent-message evidence | Outlook |
| Accepted classification and source associations | Pegasus |
| Named Engineer assignment and downstream engineering | EVA until an accepted replacement slice |
| Transient processing bytes and delivery work | Private Azure Blob and queues; never long-term custody |
| Local content-addressed artifacts | Development evidence only |

Deployed migrations are applied through the release-owned migration bundle
before application activation; the executed production record is owned by
[operations § Production environment](operations.md#production-environment).

Pegasus starts with fresh application data. The predecessor’s pre-release test cases and application state are not migrated or preserved as a `0.1.0-alpha.1` requirement.

## Database and migration boundary

EF migrations under `src/Pegasus.Infrastructure/Persistence/Migrations/` own application schema evolution.

Normal Web or Worker startup never applies migrations. Development migration is a separate explicit LocalDB command. The LocalDB guard accepts an empty database or the exact current SQL Server migration history; unexpected schema or history, or a pending model change, fails before normal application use.

A release-owned migration bundle or explicit operation must apply deployed migrations before the application package. Schema recovery is not an automatic down-migration.

The platform's supported local SQL Server (LocalDB on Windows, a per-run container on Linux) is the canonical local provider for persistence, migration, concurrency, and recovery evidence. Each disposable result proves only the exercised local behavior; it does not prove Azure SQL locking, upgrade behavior, recovery, or live deployment.

Report custody is implemented in the existing workflow boundary. Each generated
report version has a `CaseReportVersionLedgers` row, and
`CaseReportAssociationHistory` records approval, link, unlink, and relink actions
with ordered ledger versions and former-link metadata. Versioned approval and
Sent evidence carry the exact report-version artifact identity and hash; a
correction therefore leaves predecessor custody intact while the workflow's
current pointer advances to the successor. The latest migration preserves
pre-ledger approval and Sent rows and marks them `Unresolved` rather than
guessing a report-version association. This is implemented and covered by
local Release/LocalDB evidence; no deployed schema or cloud migration is claimed
here.

## Authentication and authorization boundary

Staff authentication and authorization are implemented and enforced:

- self-managed ASP.NET Core Identity staff sign-in with Account pages for sign-in, sign-out, password change, and access denial (`src/Pegasus.Web/Pages/Account/`);
- named authorization policies including the enforced Administrator role (`src/Pegasus.Web/Program.cs`), with Core-owned staff authorization and account administration (`src/Pegasus.Core/Identity/`);
- a server-derived authenticated action actor on intake and case mutations;
- anonymous intake review denied; disabled or stale staff sessions fail closed;
- draft confirmation as a separate authenticated mutation with optimistic-concurrency evidence;
- a gated production first-Administrator path (`--bootstrap-production-administrator`).
- a shared OpenIddict token composition at `/connect/token`: the existing
  Automation client retains its client-credentials and authorization-code +
  PKCE paths, while the configuration-gated `pegasus-desktop` public client
  uses staff password and rolling refresh grants with Identity role and
  security-stamp checks. Desktop access tokens have a 10-minute lifetime,
  refresh tokens have a 2-hour idle lifetime, and the original issue timestamp
  enforces the 8-hour absolute session cap. Token payload protection uses the
  configured Data Protection ring; OpenIddict signing/encryption credentials
  remain required for the retained authorization-code capability. Development
  uses a local development certificate with subject `CN=Collision Engineers`;
  non-Development startup fails closed unless an operator-provided certificate
  with that exact subject is configured. This is implemented and caller-proved
  by LocalDB integration tests, not a claim of deployed Desktop activation.

Login protection uses generic authentication failure plus transient request throttling rather than persistent Identity account lockout (ADR-0013 clause 12). Authentication alone does not authorize case creation; allocation still requires principal identity, durable custody, and the accepted allocation transaction. Decisions that withhold slices remain authoritative in [open decisions](open-decisions.md).

Secrets must use managed identity and RBAC where supported. Infisical or Key Vault may hold only unavoidable third-party credentials.

## Integration boundaries and deferred seams

Deferred capabilities retain only the stable identities and ports necessary for later activation. They add no caller, Azure resource, credential, route, schema, feature flag, dormant integration, or UI placeholder before activation.

### Mailbox intake

The implemented Graph source feeds the existing provider-neutral intake and
sent-evidence use cases through Worker. It must not copy receipt, extraction,
categorisation, or workflow rules into Worker.

Which mailboxes inbound intake reads is Core-owned and database-backed: Core
asks the approved-mailbox estate for the pollable mailboxes and iterates them,
so the decision never sits in a Worker function or in an adapter. The sources
are stateless with respect to the mailbox — every mailbox and folder identity
comes from the lease, not from configuration closed over at composition — which
is what lets one Graph client serve the whole estate. Each mailbox holds its own
lease, its own cursor, and its own last-failure code, so a mailbox that fails is
released alone and the rest of the tick continues
([ADR-0022](adr/0022-approved-mailbox-identity-and-enablement-database-setting.md)).
Sent-evidence polling remains configuration-driven for one mailbox.

The current implementation uses the Graph mailbox identity as the inbound
poll-state key, carries a cursor when the configured fallback identity is
adopted, and builds the receipt token from that identity. The target is the
stable-identity model — `ApprovedMailbox.Id` as the durable source identity, a
versioned Graph cursor-scope fingerprint, an immutable receipt-token identity,
and one explicit fresh-start activation time per mailbox, with global Worker,
individual-Function, and per-mailbox controls kept separate. That technical
decision is
[ADR-0024](adr/0024-stable-approved-mailbox-identity-and-explicit-baseline.md)
and the required behaviour is specified in
[FRD-08](frd/frd-08-email-mailbox-and-background-processing.md); the migration to
it is tracked on the Kanmer board and is not yet implemented. The production
Worker is enabled (see [operations](operations.md#production-environment)); until
that migration lands, production inbound Graph coordinates are not rebound or
replaced and cursors are not cleared outside it.

The poll also writes a retained-message read model — mailbox, folder scope,
immutable and conversation identities, sender, recipients, subject, received
time, excerpt, attachment names, media types and decoded sizes, and read state
— which is what the `/Inbox` workspace displays. It is written once, between
the accepted `ReceiveIntake` and the cursor advance, and never updated: a
redelivery is refused by the unique index on mailbox and message identity, so
what the row records is what arrived. The Worker holds `SELECT, INSERT` on
those tables and Web holds `SELECT` alone.

That read model stores `BodyPlainText`, not only the excerpt. The alternative —
re-reading the retained MIME artifact on every view, or waiting for the
processed receipt's evidence — leaves the viewer blank exactly where it is most
needed: on a workstation with no Worker running, nothing has processed the
message, and re-reading the artifact per view puts a blob fetch and a MIME
parse on the read path of a list-and-detail screen. The body is already
flattened inert text when it is written, so it is stored as the text it will be
rendered as. Message-level retention starts from the tick that first wrote it;
nothing backfills earlier mail, and the list surfaces that gap rather than
presenting an empty scope as "nothing was received"
([open decisions](open-decisions.md#mail-workspace-freshness-threshold-and-retention-start)).

The Graph mailbox intake route was live-verified under exact Exchange
Application RBAC for release 1. The production Worker is enabled; the current
runtime state of the mailbox Graph trigger is owned by
[operations § Production environment](operations.md#production-environment).
The historical verification predates the administrator-managed estate and the
retained-message read model described above, and does not extend to them: both
are proven at local-caller tier only, and neither has run against a deployed
environment.

Its adapter boundary provides:

- managed-identity access;
- Azure Blob staging;
- Box custody behind the existing Core port;
- delivery identity and duplicate-delivery handling;
- bounded retries and terminal failure visibility;
- exact Outlook sent-message evidence where required.

The current QDOS extraction policy must not be reinterpreted as mailbox categorisation.

### OCR and recognition

A first Document Intelligence caller may submit only persisted scan-like PDF page candidates. Ordinary images and vehicle photographs are outside that slice. Vehicle-registration recognition is implemented as the in-process ONNX engine selected by ADR-0019, scanning image-only intake automatically; it performs no image egress and no external OCR call. Document Intelligence OCR for scan-like PDFs remains absent. DVLA/DVSA adapters are implemented and the lookup path is composed in both runtime profiles (the Web records staff requests — replay in DevelopmentOffline, live-enabled in Production — and the production Worker owns the live adapter). Since release 15 an automatic sweep on the worker's reconciliation timer enqueues one lookup for every active case whose current registration (confirmed, else extracted fact) has never been looked up — idempotent per case and registration via the durable request row — so DVSA evidence and the mileage estimate arrive without a staff request, and the assessment page prefills its Mileage and Source from that evidence.

### Provider API and Automation MCP

Provider API and Automation MCP are separate Web ingress boundaries. They must invoke the same Core business actions as staff UI or Worker callers rather than introducing parallel policy engines. The provider API's exact client, actor, authentication, and activation evidence remain separately gated.

The native desktop gateway is a third Web ingress boundary at `/api/v1`,
composed in the existing `Pegasus.Web` host behind `Features:DesktopGateway`.
Its route group supplies correlation identifiers and RFC 9457 problem details;
endpoint authorization and business projections remain owned by the later
gateway tickets. Its first-party `pegasus-desktop` session is issued by the
shared `/connect/token` composition described above. This source-state entry
does not establish that the feature flag is enabled in any deployed
environment.

The Automation MCP ingress is implemented in `Pegasus.Web` per ADR-0011, ADR-0013 clause 10, and ADR-0026: `ActorKind.Automation` is a Core actor granted exactly the ordinary casework surface (every administration, system-work, and request-upload right is denied and unknown rights fail closed), one seeded OpenIddict registration authenticates the single vendor-neutral Automation client by client credentials or, for external connectors with administrator-configured redirect URIs, by authorization code with PKCE after Administrator consent (ADR-0027), and a streamable-HTTP MCP endpoint at `/mcp` exposes 35 typed tools wrapping existing Core case, intake, Unidentified, Triage, document, assessment, and mail use cases with per-area scopes (`automation.cases`, `automation.intake`, `automation.documents`, `automation.assessment`, `automation.mail`). Unidentified receipt/group detail and exact-member source download use the retained intake owners; Triage reads, source retrieval, lifecycle, evidence, and Case association use the same queries, commands, integrity checks, versions, replay rules, and Case leases as staff. Explicit named-Engineer assignment remains separately tracked by INTK-019 and no actor-relative assignment shortcut is exposed. Automation writes are direct writes with logging parity: they present the same edit lease, operation-key replay, and version guard as staff saves, they renew that lease through the same Core use case as the staff renew control rather than re-claiming, their assessment values are stored unconfirmed for review at manual engineer assignment, professional-finding confirmation stays staff-Engineer-only, and no confirmation, report-approval, or outward-dispatch tool exists. Every tool invocation and material denial is attributable permanent history. The whole surface registers only when `Features:AutomationMcp` enables it with valid Automation MCP settings (ADR-0026); the deployed state of that gate and its dated activation evidence are owned by [operations](operations.md#production-environment), and source inventory must not be mistaken for deployed inventory.

The Send to AI hand-off (AI-09, ADR-0021) is a second gated boundary beside it: `Pegasus.Core` owns the work-request lifecycle (`AiWork`), `Pegasus.Web` composes the loopback channel transport behind `Features:SendToAi` (DevelopmentOffline only), and the channel carries operator chat only — a case-reference pointer and short instruction out, a short confirmation reply back. Business content returns exclusively through the Automation MCP ingress above; the external channel connector is a non-owned client, never a policy owner, and never part of any deployment.

### EVA and case lifecycle

EVA remains authoritative for named Engineer assignment and downstream engineering until an accepted replacement. Pegasus now implements the focused manual handoff locally: `Pegasus.Core` owns Review-only generation, required-custody and current-evidence eligibility, deterministic bundle composition, frozen revisions, reasoned download, and the once-per-Case `First sent to Engineer` proxy. The authenticated Case surface and composition-gated Automation ingress call those Core use cases; EF persists revision/download truth, and no EVA network client exists. Custody retry is a separate human-only Core use case reached by the Case surface, while the Worker processes the same persisted custody work through Infrastructure adapters.

The Box adapters use the immutable Case/PO reference for final folder names. Since release 18 an audit carries **one** identity, not two: its own reference holds the `a.` (Repairable) or `ap.` (Total Loss) prefix taken from the original report, no separate Audit reference is allocated, and its files sit in that one case folder — which also closed a split where the root was created under the audit identity while lookups used the case reference. A later Audit reference on a non-audit case still gets its own folder. A predeclared creation-owner token is used only in a transient staging folder so a lost create response can be reconciled through the same replay; an ETag-guarded same-parent promotion completes creation. The durable folder identity is the database-stored remote folder id — root validation compares that id, and no marker file is written inside the folder (the operator-decided release-15 change; the image fold still deletes a legacy binding file when present). Each attachment of the accepted instruction is retained beside the source, flat in the case folder at ordinals `002` onward, replay-verified — release 17 removed the `Evidence/<role>/<occurrence>/<revision>` nesting and its two binding sidecars, which were never asked for, and recorded intake's files as case documents so the case can list and open what Box already held. Release 18 completed the other half: the case Evidence gallery reads those document records and serves the images through the case-document route rather than from the Azure staging blob, which is transient and ages out. A case accepted before those records existed still renders from its retained asset. Since release 16 the same custody operation also promotes the receipt's extracted embedded photographs as individual files after the attachments: `InstructionEvidenceImages.Select` (Core) admits attached images always and embedded images at or above the 40 KB photograph floor, never inline images, hash-deduped preferring the attached copy; the selected images render as the case Evidence tab's instruction-photographs gallery through the receipt-asset image endpoint. Managed source, document, version, and nested Audit paths remain business-readable. Local in-memory-adapter and SQL caller proof does not establish production Box migration, deployment, external receipt, named-Engineer assignment, or operator drag-and-drop acceptance.

### Workspaces

`workspaces/` contains independently buildable source workspaces:

- document extraction;
- report rendering.

They are not:

- projects in `Pegasus.slnx`;
- application dependencies;
- runtime-loaded components;
- current callers;
- deployment units;
- business-policy authorities.

They build and test independently. `Pegasus.Core` remains the sole business-policy owner.

A workspace may enter the application only through a separately accepted contract with:

- a real caller;
- representative parity evidence;
- security and licence evidence;
- migration or coexistence behavior;
- failure and recovery behavior;
- operator acceptance.

Workspace provenance and source manifests are owned by [the workspace index](../workspaces/README.md).

## Release dependency provenance

Exact release allocation in [capabilities](capabilities.md) does not by itself define implementation order. The predecessor delivery roadmap (git history) recorded prerequisite edges; revalidate any of its claims against current requirements, allocation, decisions, architecture, and code before use.

The retained alpha spine orders relational intake state before staff identity and action history; those before principal/configuration, durable custody, image/address evidence, and the allocator; those before definitive acceptance; and acceptance before case files, edit leases, lifecycle, UI, Worker callers, Triage, vehicle/EVA work, Automation MCP, Azure/recovery evidence, and operator acceptance. Provider activation and later parallel branches rejoin only after their shared actor, source, case, Worker, and history contracts are stable. This summary neither activates an external capability nor proves deployment, recovery, or acceptance.

## Failure and recovery boundaries

Source limits, incomplete processing, identity ambiguity, unsupported formats, integrity conflicts, and persistence or custody failures fail closed before case or reference creation.

Transient work may retry only within named bounds. Terminal failures must remain visible. Local bytes may outlive a failed SQL write and are not evidence of accepted custody.

Worker timer and poison-queue callers reconcile persisted intake and external-work failures. For Box custody, an initial failed operation remains terminal and visible for authorised staff to retry; no automatic business retry is permitted. These source-level callers do not prove live Azure queue delivery, deployment, or operator acceptance.

The numbered forward-recovery procedure is owned by the [runbook](runbook.md), and the OPS-09 four-hour restoration and 15-minute recovery-point targets are owned by [operations](operations.md); both remain unproved (OPS-09 — deferred; gates no release).

## Deployment boundary

The intended topology is isolated local development and production only — there
is no Azure development, test, integration, or staging environment (see
[ADR-0014](adr/0014-local-to-production-deployment.md)). The production resource
inventory and SKUs, the deploy procedure, and the rule that any Azure resource
creation, deployment, role or credential change, setting change, or retirement
requires explicit user approval for the exact target are owned by
[operations § production environment](operations.md#production-environment), the
[runbook](runbook.md#deployment-and-release), and the
[runbook approval matrix](runbook.md#live-operation-approval-matrix). Bicep
compilation proves syntax and type consistency only, and deployment does not
prove an untested provider outcome.

## Local development procedure

The local development procedure, its platform differences, and its evidence
limits are owned by the [runbook](runbook.md#supported-platform); the
platform-specific database is owned by the
[local database](runbook.md#local-database). This section describes only what
the resulting configuration selects.

Development configuration selects:

- runtime profile `DevelopmentOffline`;
- the platform's supported SQL Server, which is SQL Server Express LocalDB on Windows and a per-run container on Linux;
- connection name `Pegasus`;
- database `PegasusDevelopment`;
- artifact root `artifacts/local-development/default/intake`;
- `Features:LocalIntake=true`.

The `--migrate-development` process validates the local-only profile, applies the committed migration stream, prints completion, and exits. The Web host must then be started separately.

The staff `/Received/{id}`, `/Received/{id}/Source`, and `/Inbox` routes are served wherever intake is composed and return `404` everywhere else. Manual upload has its own `/Upload` page and no longer runs through a separately gated handler on a received-item list; every successful upload redirects to the staff `/Upload/Status/{id}` page, which reads the staged receipt's Received, Processing, Complete or Failed state and returns `404` for unknown identifiers.

## Evidence qualifications

The dated test-count checkpoints, corpus inventories, and the qualifications on what those results do and do not prove are owned by [operations § dated evidence](operations.md#dated-evidence-qualifications).

## Architectural constraints

These constraints — no duplicated rule engines, dormant integrations, generic
services, speculative abstractions, or compatibility shims for unreleased
behaviour; no inferring authority from a predecessor, local corpus, supplied
references, plans, tests, dependency registration, migration presence, or
workspace import; no enabling a route because a package, adapter, port,
migration, or test exists; no copying intake rules into Worker; no treating
local artifacts or transient Blob storage as Box custody; and no treating
accepted design as implementation, implementation as caller proof, caller proof
as deployment, or deployment as operator acceptance — are governance owned by
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) (its safety rails and Repository task workflow). This
file is wired to follow them; it does not own them.

Product intent is owned by the [PRD](prd/README.md), functional behaviour by the [FRDs](frd/README.md), capability scope by [capabilities](capabilities.md), unresolved gates by [open decisions](open-decisions.md), operational procedures by the [runbook](runbook.md), current operational evidence by [operations](operations.md), repository-development workflow by [engineering](engineering.md), and business authority by [operator notes](operator-notes.md). Repository navigation is maintained by the [documentation index](index.md), and durable change history by git history.
