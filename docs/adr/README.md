# Decision index

Architecture Decision Records capture durable **technical/architectural** product
decisions only. The conventions for writing them — stable IDs, YAML frontmatter,
one decision per ADR, supersede-don't-renumber — live in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md#adr-conventions). Documentation rules, product
intent, and feature behaviour are **not** ADRs; see the PRD/FRD taxonomy in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) and the [documentation index](../index.md).

Every ADR carries frontmatter (`id`, `status`, `date`, `supersedes`,
`superseded_by`, `related_capabilities`, `related_frd`, `tags`). The **current
architecture is the set below with `status: accepted`**. Published bodies are
immutable; a changed decision is recorded by a new, superseding ADR — IDs are
never renumbered or reused.

ADR-0017 was never issued (a numbering collision while filing 0018/0019); the gap
is intentional and the number is not reused.

Acceptance of a decision is design authority within its scope. No ADR proves
implementation, a real caller, deployment, live verification, or operator
acceptance unless separately named evidence records that exact state.
