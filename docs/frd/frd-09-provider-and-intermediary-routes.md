# FRD-09: Provider and intermediary routes

## Unidentified route outcome

An unresolved provider/intermediary route is Unidentified only when the received
material itself is safely retained but no unique owner or destination can be
established. The route evidence and bounded reason are preserved under one U
reference; a reasoned policy refusal remains Blocked intake and a retryable technical
failure remains processing.

## Provider and intermediary routes

Provider identity, intermediary identity, route identity, and
provider/domain-suffix association are separate facts. The versioned
provider/domain package is evidence and configuration input; package presence
does not activate a route, choose a principal, or define an API client.

Direct-provider and intermediary policies may differ, but both call the same
Core intake contract and fail closed when route identity, enabled policy,
principal, or mandatory evidence is missing. The [capability
inventory](../capabilities.md) owns the exact targets for additional-provider
routes and provider APIs.

### Provider API principal and contract boundary

The accepted provider-API security boundary is the stable Pegasus principal,
not an email domain or general external tenant. A provider client receives a
separately issued principal-scoped client ID and opaque secret; only the secret
hash is stored, and rotation and revocation are supported. The client may
submit instructions/attachments idempotently and retrieve only that
principal's own receipt, processing status, and resulting Case/PO. It receives
no staff access, general case search/read, or case-workflow mutation.

Provider operations use the same Core intake and authorization policies as Web
and Worker callers. Receipt, submission, status, result, source-custody, and
idempotency identities remain distinct per principal, and the provider client
is the attributable action actor. Cross-principal query or result disclosure
fails closed. The transport channel alone never changes extraction, instruction
eligibility, or automatic allocation: a definitive provider-API instruction
for its authenticated principal follows the same case-creation path as an
equally definitive email instruction.

**Source limitation:** the accepted sources do not define an external tenant
model, exact routes, headers, schema, attachment encoding, request limits,
throttling policy, administration UI, or a Pegasus identity/field named
`provider_domain_key`. No allowed source proves an owner or current/predecessor
consumer for that name. Pegasus therefore does not create, migrate, map, alias,
or retire it. Any later proposal must first establish authoritative source and
consumer evidence, stable-principal/route/provenance mapping, collision and
unknown handling, cutover, rollback, retention, and explicit retirement proof
through the separate [open
decision](../open-decisions.md#external-data-submission-and-report-contracts);
none may be inferred from provider-domain evidence.

No provider route is active until its exact capability allocation, accepted
contract, credentials/scopes, failure and recovery proof, real caller, and
operator acceptance exist.

### Accepted QDOS automatic case-association predicates

> Owner capability: route association (QDOS direct). Relocated from ADR-0020 (2026-08-03). Instantiates the route-policy association frame for the QDOS direct route and supersedes the earlier single-domain QDOS sender identity with the operator-accepted three-domain set. General multi-rule precedence and confidence questions remain open in [open decisions](../open-decisions.md#mailbox-rule-activation-automatic-matching-and-confidence-display).

For mail on the accepted QDOS direct route only:

1. **Route identity.** QDOS direct sender identity is exact whole-domain equality against `qdosassist.co.uk`, `qdoslaw.co.uk`, or `qdosassists.co.uk` (`qdos_mail_route` v3) — no suffix or subdomain widening. An accepted domain alone still classifies nothing and associates nothing.
2. **Match keys** (`qdos_case_match` v1), extracted label-anchored with a required separator, never scraped from free text: the claim reference normalized to its durable token (the `NNNNN/N` tail for `qdosassist` references, full or bare; the letters grammar for `qdoslaw` references), the client-vehicle registration compacted to `[A-Z0-9]` (TP-prefixed labels are never harvested), and the claimant name as title-stripped surname plus first initial. Multiple distinct values for one key withdraw that key. The incident date (labelled fields plus the generated subject `on DD/MM/YYYY`) is never a positive key.
3. **Eliminator procedure.** Candidates are every QDOS case matching ANY key, in every lifecycle state (the operator confirmed staff do not archive; a post-report case is post-report stage). A candidate contradicted by the message's incident date or by another identity key present on both sides is eliminated. Exactly one survivor is an automatic association; zero is no match (instructions proceed to the normal creation gates); several fail closed as the recorded Ambiguous outcome, forcing `Needs sorting` with the competing candidates visible. A `Created in error` survivor redirects to its linked replacement case and is never associated itself. `NoKeys` remains distinguishable from `NoMatch`. No numeric confidence score, threshold, or display exists anywhere.
4. **Recording and reversal.** Every evaluation persists a decision record (keys, per-candidate hits and eliminations with reasons, outcome, policy key and version) one-to-one with the intake receipt. An automatic association is written idempotently by the system-worker identity with the match policy stamped, no-ops when any active association exists, and is reversible through the ordinary staff unlink with full history.

This pulls the QDOS-direct subset of MAIL-09 forward to `Now / 0.1.0-alpha.1`. General multi-provider association, the classified-email workspace, and every other route's matchers remain allocated `Next / 0.3.0`.

### Accepted QDOS triage-request route

The accepted QDOS message-type policy owns the automatic Triage trigger. A
classified `pre-instruction-emails/triage-request` is pre-case work: it never
enters normal case allocation and produces one strong `AcceptedTriageMatch`
evidence entry derived from the classification policy key, version, matched
predicate, detail, and source. A usable vehicle registration opens the Triage;
without one, the retained receipt is registered as Unidentified after the
Triage attempt. Ambiguous or unclassified messages fail closed and produce no
automatic Triage. No second intake-triage matcher is composed.

Consequences: the predicates are Core-owned, code-versioned policy (`QdosCaseMatchPolicy`, the shared eliminator in `EvaluateIntakeCaseMatch`); a behaviour change is a version bump, never a silent redefinition, and any normalization change requires an explicit rebuild of the derived match index. The match index is a read model of accepted case data maintained in the same transaction by every case-data writer — case acceptance, staff case-data save, vehicle-suggestion confirmation, and Created in error replacement creation — all through one shared projector. The predecessor's false-registration shapes (`AND2`, `OCTOBER`, postcode outward codes, `X5 NOW`) are pinned as negative tests. No generic rule engine, rule table, or admin editor is introduced; a second provider's matcher needs its own operator-accepted predicates and policy.
