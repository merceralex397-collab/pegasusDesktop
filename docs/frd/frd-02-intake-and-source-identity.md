## Intake and source identity

### Ways intake starts

Intake may begin through staff-forwarded email, a staff-created request-scoped upload link, provider material, manually supplied files, images, correspondence, or a future approved API route. Receipt is not case creation.

Image-only material with a usable normalised VRM creates a searchable Image-initiated Case projection with an Image Intake Reference; it is not Unidentified merely because it lacks a formal instruction or accepted Principal. A usable normalised VRM is a staff-confirmed registration or an automatic engine read that meets the accepted recognition bar (operator-accepted 2026-08-03; [operations § dated evidence](../operations.md#dated-evidence-qualifications) owns the accepted numbers). Image material without a usable normalised VRM enters Unidentified with a required reason. An Image-initiated Case is never allocated a formal Case/PO; it merges into one matching formal Case or is staff-closed with a reason.

A usable registration therefore settles into one of two outcomes the operator
sees (operator ruling, 2026-08-19): when it matches no existing Case, the
Image-initiated Case is the visible, searchable, awaiting-instruction outcome
until something changes it; when it matches exactly one eligible Case at
registration time, the reference is still allocated but the automatic merge
below runs in the same pipeline pass, so what the operator finds is the images
already attached as evidence on that Case, with the Image-initiated reference
retained as linked history rather than a separate open record.

### Unidentified destination and reference

Safely retained material whose identity, meaning, ownership, or destination cannot be
established becomes one `UnidentifiedItem` for the source occurrence or inseparable
submission group. Group membership is durable: one group receives one `U<n>` reference
and every member keeps its own filename, receipt identity, custody, and chronology.
The reference is uppercase `U` followed by positive, invariant, unpadded decimal
digits, allocated atomically from a dedicated sequence and never reused. The item
stores one of the six Core-owned reasons—unreadable/corrupt, unsupported, no usable
identification, conflicting identification, ambiguous ownership/destination, or
terminal technical processing failure—and bounded safe detail. Retryable work does
not allocate a reference.

Unidentified is open or resolved. Authorised staff resolution requires an operation
key, expected version, reason, and one supported destination; it appends immutable
history with actor, time, target, and before/after state. Replays return the original
result; conflicting operation reuse fails closed. An open item whose origin receipt
subsequently reaches a real destination — a formal Case, or a registered Image
intake — is resolved automatically to that destination by the product's own
reconciliation (in the receipt's own processing pass, and by a sweep for receipts
promoted outside their own pass), with the destination recorded in the item's
history; a receipt that is still legitimately unidentified is never force-closed.
The U-reference is never accepted as a Case/PO, Audit, Image Intake, or principal
identity.

Every intake path must:

- preserve original source bytes and message/file identity before deriving text or classifications;
- retain sender, recipients, subject, message identifiers, timestamps, attachment names, content types, byte lengths, hashes, and parent/placement relationships where available;
- be idempotent for the same source occurrence without collapsing distinct visible placements;
- surface unsupported, incomplete, corrupt, encrypted, oversized, ambiguous, or technically failed input as an explicit decision rather than silently dropping or accepting it;

- record the actor, time, caller, source, policy version, and reason for every transition;
- prevent untrusted content from becoming instructions, policy, identity, or authority.

When a retained source becomes Unidentified because no category can be determined, the UI shows its U-reference, canonical reason, bounded safe detail, source/group, custody, and next permitted action rather than presenting the positive rationale for an unrelated category.

### Request-scoped upload links

**Accepted source boundary:** only authenticated staff may create a link. The token has a stable identity and
is bound to exactly one upload request, its allowed operation, and a
server-enforced expiry. It is security-sensitive and is never written to
permanent business history, message content, or content-bearing telemetry.
Token generation and at-rest representation remain implementation choices;
acceptance must prove expiry, revocation, and cross-request isolation through
the real caller. Revocation invalidates every later request, and an
unauthenticated caller cannot extend expiry.

The public page exposes only the bound request's upload fields and its immediate
structured success or failure. It exposes no case or reference identity,
request/history state, other document, token-management function, external
account, or cross-request lookup. An accepted upload result means only that the
request-local custody boundary succeeded; it is not case creation, Box custody,
EVA handoff, report generation, or external delivery.

File type/count/size limits, authentication of the staff creator, token expiry
and revocation, idempotent retry, abuse handling, durable custody, cross-request
isolation, and non-disclosing error behavior are acceptance gates.
Every attempt returns the same bounded result classes without revealing whether
another request, case, reference, or file exists. This in-house route supersedes
Box File Request behavior.

### Source occurrence and dispatch identity

A source occurrence is the channel-scoped receipt identity for one visible receipt or placement. It is distinct from its content hash, extracted evidence, processing dispatch, and any accepted Case projection.

- Replaying the same occurrence with the same bytes returns the existing receipt.
- Reusing an occurrence identity for different bytes is a visible identity conflict; it creates no new receipt, association, case, or reference.
- Equal bytes received under different permitted occurrence identities remain separate evidence with separate provenance.

Pegasus acknowledges receipt only after the original bytes, source receipt, and one durable processing-dispatch record commit. Each dispatch has its own stable idempotency identity tied to the source occurrence; a queue carries only the stable source/work identifier, never the payload. This acknowledgement means “durably received for processing,” not classified, associated, accepted as a case, completed, or closed.

The Web receipt path stages work as pending and never executes queued-intake
processing. The Worker is the sole processing owner: it dispatches pending work,
claims queue deliveries idempotently, recovers expired leases, and records a
completed or failed outcome. The existing reconciliation sweep also returns an
unleased dispatched item that has exceeded its bounded recovery age to pending,
so it can be dispatched again rather than stranded as Received. Duplicate
delivery must not duplicate an evaluation, case, reference, or downstream side
effect. Staff can inspect Received,
Processing, Complete, or Failed by the staged receipt identifier; failure wording
is bounded and does not disclose exception or infrastructure detail.

### Mandatory pre-case gates

Before creating a case or allocating a reference, Pegasus must establish:

- successful source persistence and required extraction/classification receipts;
- authenticated Principal identity and the staff actor where the route requires staff;
- provider/intermediary route identity and enabled policy where relevant;
- unambiguous case type and Principal association;
- processing and size/format limits;
- absence of unresolved wrong-Principal, duplicate-occurrence, receipt-integrity, or source-custody ambiguity.

Once those identity-critical facts are established, Pegasus creates the Case/PO
and allocates its permanent reference. Incomplete ordinary business detail,
images, or mandatory external checks retain that Case as `Not ready`; they do
not form another pre-Case acceptance gate. An Audit's retained original report
is identity-critical: without one separate report with one literal outcome,
Pegasus cannot determine whether the reference is `a.` or `ap.` and enters
`Needs sorting`. The manual case-create screen does not offer Audit; it is
created only by this retained-email route. If the route cannot establish an identity-critical fact, it persists only what is safe and enters the
corresponding pre-Case outcome. `Blocked intake` records a reason and visible
warning, offers reasoned resolve and retry actions, and retains the resolution
evidence and each retry result. It never allocates a reusable identity as a
convenience.

Box case-file custody is a required day-one alpha capability, but it follows Case/PO allocation: Pegasus uses the newly allocated immutable reference to create the Box case folder and stores the retained source material there. Blob staging remains temporary hot processing storage, not accepted Case custody. A Box folder or filing failure retains the allocated Case as `Not ready`, records the exact failure and staff-initiated retry/recovery evidence, and prevents progression that requires accepted Case custody; it never rolls back, reuses, or reallocates the immutable Case/PO reference. No background or automatic business retry is permitted.

### Matching conflicts and reversible association

Matching uses explainable evidence. Message identifiers, provider/domain policy, route identity, accepted reference tokens, VRM, party identity, and operator confirmation may contribute. A weak, ambiguous, or contradictory signal never silently associates material with a case; competing candidate cases and unresolved source-identity conflicts become Unidentified with the corresponding canonical reason.

VRM correlation is a suggestion until confirmed by accepted evidence or an authorised operator. Source deduplication is occurrence-aware: exact bytes and transport identifiers support correlation, while each visible placement and chronology entry remains auditable.

Arrival-time proximity never associates or consolidates material. A mismatch
between accepted incident dates may eliminate a candidate; a matching incident
date proves nothing alone and requires corroborating accepted evidence before
association or consolidation.

The immutable source occurrence and its evidence remain distinct from the accepted, editable Case projection. Linking creates a versioned source-to-case relationship; it never converts the source into the case, rewrites source facts, or changes the original intake origin.

An Image-initiated Case remains Awaiting instruction until its retained evidence can associate with exactly one eligible pre-report instructed Case. Automatic association requires an unambiguous normalised VRM match and no explicit contradictory identity evidence; otherwise an authorised staff member makes the reasoned decision. A Case after report delivery is not eligible. Association retains both permanent identities and source histories: the instructed Case/PO remains the sole formal Case identity and the Image Intake Reference remains linked history. On a unique match the Image-initiated Case becomes Merged into Instruction-initiated Case; if instructions never arrive, staff may record a permanent Staff-closed outcome with a reason. Neither identity, source fact, or relationship event is reused, rewritten, or deleted.

Image-only material with a usable VRM therefore creates a searchable Image-initiated Case reference, not a formal Case/PO. A group with no usable VRM or conflicting valid VRMs follows the Unidentified contract with its explicit reason marker instead.

**Age and chase state (INT-32).** Each half of a pairing keeps its own chronology: the instruction side's opened/received timestamp and the Image-initiated Case's own `RegisteredAtUtc`, both already visible on their respective queue rows — no relative "age" figure is computed or shown anywhere in the application, so none is introduced for either half. While an Image-initiated Case is Awaiting instruction, its chase-due state is a derived read, not a persisted schedule: it is due once `RegisteredAtUtc` has stood for the same seven-calendar-day interval a Not-ready formal Case's first chase falls due at, and not-due before that. There is no held or stopped state and no generated chaser draft for the image half — those exist on the Case side because a formal Case has manual chase-pause controls and outbound chaser text; an Image-initiated Case has neither, and this ticket does not add them. Pairing completion remains visible the way INT-32's coupled INT-28 already delivered it: the derived `Associated with Case` label wherever the origin receipt's case association is shown, and the merge event recorded on the resulting Case's own history the moment it happens — not a separate notification.

### Grouped image-intake routing

**Settled operator truth (2026-08-19):** a retained vehicle image either shows a
readable registration that matches an existing eligible Case — in which case
every image attaches to that Case as evidence — or it shows a readable
registration that matches no existing Case, in which case it starts the
Image intake's own pre-Case identity. A multi-file manual upload is one
evidence group, not a set of independent images: a damage close-up carrying no
registration must not detach itself from an overview image selected with it in
the same submission, and the group — never an individual image — is the unit
that reaches an association, a pre-Case Image intake registration, or a
`Needs sorting` outcome.

- **Membership and completeness.** A group's member count is fixed at the
  originating submission and is never inferred from however many members
  happen to be durably stored yet. Routing is evaluated only once every
  declared member is present and every present member's image evidence
  carries a terminal recognition outcome (a suggestion, no-readable-result, an
  unavailable dependency, or a technical failure all count as terminal — an
  empty or still-processing result does not). A group short of its declared
  membership, or carrying any non-terminal member, reaches no decision and is
  re-evaluated as later members complete.
- **Non-image members are excluded.** A batch may mix vehicle images with
  other material submitted in the same request (for example an instruction
  document). Only members whose retained evidence is image-only material
  contribute to recognition and to the group's routing decision; a non-image
  member's presence still counts toward the declared membership check above,
  but it is never scanned for a vehicle registration and never blocks the
  image members' own decision.
- **Distinct-VRM aggregation.** Only reads at or above the accepted automatic
  recognition bar count. The decision inspects the distinct set of accepted,
  normalised VRMs across every image member in the group — never one member's
  read in isolation.
- **Associate-or-hand-off precedence, applied in this order:**
  1. Any image member's recognition ended in a technical failure or an
     unavailable dependency: the group fails closed to a named technical
     outcome. No association or registration is attempted while any member's
     evidence is unreliable.
  2. Exactly one distinct accepted VRM across the group, and exactly one
     eligible pre-report instructed Case carries it: every member in the
     group associates to that Case as evidence, under the same unambiguous
     normalised-match rule (including its confirmed-registration completion
     for a one-character-missing read) that governs single-image association
     above.
  3. Exactly one distinct accepted VRM, but zero or more than one eligible
     instructed Case carries it: the VRM is usable but not uniquely matched.
     The group registers as **one** pre-Case Image intake identity — exactly
     one Image Intake Reference is allocated for the whole submission group,
     never one per member — and every member's receipt and retained evidence
     records against that single registration; none associates to any Case.
     This FRD does not re-specify the further searchable lifecycle of that
     pre-Case identity.
  4. Zero distinct accepted VRMs, or more than one (conflicting readable
     VRMs): no single usable identity exists. The intact group — every member
     together, kept as one unit — remains `Needs sorting`; no VRM-based
     reference is fabricated for it, and no member is split off into an
     unrelated generic outcome.
- **Fail-closed is a group property, not a per-member one.** Case 3 and case 4
  above ("no unique match" and "ambiguous/conflicting") are handled
  distinctly but both withhold association. A per-member candidate search run
  while registering that member's evidence must never resolve an ambiguity
  the group itself did not resolve: if the group's own eligible-Case count
  for its one accepted VRM was zero or more than one, no member of that group
  may associate to a Case, even where a member-level search over the same
  candidates could otherwise select one by exact match. The group's own
  decision is the sole authority for whether association happens.
- **Recognition is idempotent per retained image.** A group can be
  re-evaluated more than once (a sibling member arriving, a replay). An image
  whose recognition outcome is already durably recorded is never re-scanned;
  the recorded outcome is reused so each retained image is recognised once
  regardless of how many times its group is evaluated.

Each direct Case datum retains its current field provenance: staff entry,
extraction, AI prefill or proposal, provider API, or another external
vehicle/estimate source with its applicable identity, version, and time.
Operator UI shows that provenance without treating it as confirmation. A
derived value identifies its accepted inputs and calculation rather than
claiming a separate raw source; provenance and value status remain distinct.

### Upload confirmation surface

Once a manually uploaded file's processing resolves (Complete or Failed), the
operator sees a confirmation decision rather than a passive status label. The
decision is per file — a grouped upload's members can terminal-decide
independently, so the surface never assumes one outcome for a whole group.

The decision table, evaluated once per file:

1. **A case is already associated** (`CurrentCaseId` set). This is always a
   report of something automation already did — the "linked automatically
   only on a definitive match" rule (operator notes) means a unique
   `CaseMatchOutcome` match or the grouped-image-routing unique match above
   is written before Complete is ever reached, so the confirmation step never
   re-offers this as a choice. The operator sees the case reference, a link
   to open it, and the existing reversal path (staff link/unlink) rather than
   a second association mechanism.
2. **Registered as a new Image-initiated Case** (`ImageIntakeRegistered`).
   Also always automatic (a usable VRM with no unique existing-Case match);
   reported with a link to its own searchable surface, never re-offered as a
   manual creation (an Image-initiated Case's reference is VRM-keyed and
   cannot be hand-created without one). While the registration is still
   Awaiting instruction, the surface additionally offers the staff decision
   to add the uploaded material to an existing case found by search (below);
   that decision links the registration's origin receipt, which carries the
   Image-initiated Case through its normal merge transition. Once merged,
   the surface reports the destination case instead of the registration.
3. **Routed to Unidentified.** Automation abstained (no usable/conflicting
   VRM, or no identifiable match at all); reported with a link to the
   existing Unidentified resolution surface, which is where the staff
   decision for that item actually happens.
4. **Possible matching cases found** (`CaseMatchOutcome.Ambiguous`).
   Automation found candidates but none met the unique-match bar — this is
   the genuine staff decision the confirmation step offers: review the
   candidates and attach, freely choosing a different destination than any
   suggested candidate (the operator's "they can override").
5. **No matching case at all**, and the file is otherwise eligible to become
   one. The staff decision offered here is to create a case from what was
   uploaded — Instruction-initiated, seeded from the file — reusing the
   existing creation screen.
6. **Cannot become a case** (blocked, unsupported, or a technical failure) or
   **the file itself failed to process.** Reported plainly; no offer, since
   none is genuine.

Where the staff decision is genuinely open — rows 2 (still Awaiting
instruction), 4 and 5 — the surface also carries the decision itself:

- **Add to an existing case.** A case search that suggests matching cases as
  the operator types (the existing staff case-search query; reference,
  registration, claimant and stage shown — never an internal identifier).
  Selecting a case and confirming, with a required reason, is an explicit
  staff decision: it acquires the case's edit lease and links the receipt
  through the existing staff link path, which also runs the Image-initiated
  Case merge transition where one is registered. The decision is replay-safe
  (deterministic per receipt and case), and fails closed — an unresolved or
  ambiguous typed reference, a version or lease conflict, or a receipt that
  already has a case all report an honest error and change nothing. Nothing
  is ever attached silently beyond the automatic bar above.
- **Cancel.** Returns to the Upload screen and changes nothing: the material
  stays retained and its state stays honestly reported.

Every other action the confirmation surface offers routes to an existing
surface that already performs it (case details, the received-item screen's
attach/reverse controls, the case-creation screen, the Image-initiated Case
and Unidentified detail screens).

### Global vehicle and value checks

Every Case must satisfy globally required vehicle identity/specification,
vehicle-history/risk, and market-valuation checks, unless an explicit,
documented exception applies. All three results or their recorded exceptions
are required before staff may accept Case review and expose the Case in the
Engineers queue. The authorised staff reviewer may record an exception as a
named, reasoned Case action in permanent history. Provider and route policy
select the provider, required result, acceptable provenance, and
unavailable/failure behavior for each check; no provider is inferred by this
requirement.

Vehicle details are extracted from the instruction where available, otherwise
obtained from the applicable DVLA/MOT source. Mileage evidence ranks as:

1. an accepted staff-entered value;
2. directly extracted instruction text;
3. Document Intelligence extraction from a scanned instruction or future
   odometer-vision evidence; and
4. a DVSA-derived estimate.

DVSA is run for every Case. Where no higher-tier mileage value is available, it
supplies the source-labelled estimate. A difference between DVSA mileage and
any accepted staff-entered, instruction-extracted, Document Intelligence, or
odometer value is a visible Case discrepancy. The later odometer-vision
capability does not imply an activated AI caller before its own accepted
evaluation and integration contract.

The DVSA estimate follows [ADR-0012](../adr/0012-conservative-mot-mileage-estimation.md):
it preserves raw observations, validates units, groups fail/retest episodes,
segments corroborated odometer drops, and excludes implausible or
low-information intervals without deleting them. It uses a recency- and
quality-weighted median of clean rates, with a versioned cohort prior only for
eligible sparse histories; interpolation and forecasting remain bounded. An
estimate without eligible chronological holdouts is a wider, explicitly
non-probabilistic range and never defaults into the Case.

Definitive authorised intake creates exactly one instructed Case idempotently. A definitive match to an existing instructed Case allocates no duplicate. A new instructed Case enters `Not ready` until its ordinary business detail, required source images, and applicable progression requirements are satisfied; the route may move it to `Review` only when its explicit policy permits that transition. The allocation decision adds no universal manual acceptance gate.

One source occurrence has at most one current Case association. Every automatic or manual association records the exact source and Case identities, evidence, actor, time, policy/version, and reason where required. Any authorised staff member may reasonedly unlink or reassociate a mistaken match; the prior relationship and both source origins remain permanent, and dependent facts and counts recompute without deleting history.
