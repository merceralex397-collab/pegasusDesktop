## Reports, correspondence, and reviewed proposals

Reports are produced from accepted case facts and source-labelled evidence
through the approved renderer boundary. Renderer source workspaces remain
independent source imports until an accepted integration contract and real
application caller exist.

### Assessment-report outcomes

Assessment rendering (RPT-02) has one closed outcome vocabulary:
`total_loss`, `repairable`, `cash_in_lieu`, and `contract_repair`. Contract
repair is a distinct fourth outcome; it is not a presentation alias for
repairable. Every outcome uses the same assessment bundle: outcome and
findings, vehicle data and the repair-cost calculation, the itemised repair
specification, selected vehicle images, the statement and authorised
signature, and the fee note.

| Outcome | Title and badge | Headline figures | Settlement meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `total_loss` | `TOTAL LOSS REPORT`; `TOTAL LOSS — CATEGORY x` | Pre-accident value, repair cost including VAT, salvage value, and recommended settlement | Recommended settlement is the accepted Engineer value less the accepted salvage value; the accepted category and its approved salvage treatment are required. |
| `repairable` | `REPAIRABLE REPORT`; `REPAIRABLE` | Pre-accident value, accepted labour figure, and repair cost including VAT | Recommended settlement is the accepted external estimate total for the Engineer's repairable finding. |
| `cash_in_lieu` | `CASH IN LIEU REPORT`; `CASH IN LIEU` | Pre-accident value, accepted labour figure, and cash-in-lieu settlement | The recommended cash-in-lieu settlement is the accepted external estimate total. |
| `contract_repair` | `CONTRACT REPAIR REPORT`; `CONTRACT REPAIR` | Pre-accident value, accepted labour figure, and repair cost including VAT | The accepted external estimate's VAT-inclusive total is the agreed contract-repair cap and cannot increase. |

`Pegasus.Core` selects the outcome from the accepted Engineer finding and
owns the report projection and validates the source-labelled cost basis once;
the numeric repair figures and VAT are accepted from the selected external
estimate rather than derived from a Pegasus rate card. A caller or renderer
cannot select an outcome, provide a precomposed settlement in place of those
inputs, or reinterpret one outcome as another.
Missing, unknown, conflicting, or incomplete outcome data fails closed before
an accepted report artifact is rendered. Outcome-specific data is required
where it affects the document, including category and salvage for total loss
and the accepted raw cost components from which the selected estimate's
VAT-inclusive contract-repair cap is retained.

Supplied template, schema, wording, design, and sample material is evidence for
this contract, not a second policy owner. Any category treatment, recovery or
storage paragraph, statement-of-truth wording, qualification, signature, or
other document wording that has not been accepted remains unavailable; the
renderer must not substitute placeholder or inferred content.

### Audit report parity

When RPT-03 is activated by its own accepted caller, an Audit report uses the
same approved Inspection report contract, template, wording, layout, and
renderer presentation as the equivalent Inspection report. Audit is distinct
only in its accepted workflow provenance and immutable internal reference: the
normal Case/PO remains authoritative, with the existing `a.{Case/PO}` reference
for a repairable Audit or `ap.{Case/PO}` for a total-loss Audit. Those identity
facts travel through the shared Core-owned report contract; they do not select
or create a separate physical report family.

Missing, conflicting, ambiguous, stale, or cross-case Audit outcome or
reference evidence fails closed before rendering. Audit must not introduce a
second template, wording, layout, report model, conservative/maximised
specification pair, or monetary or percentage uplift. This future behaviour
does not open the current renderer surface or supply a caller; the closed
activation boundary below remains in force.

### Initial renderer activation

The first active renderer surface is closed to the `rendererref1` assessment
and its fee note. Audit, diminution, addendum, valuation-evidence, generic
letter, and every other former workspace catalogue family are unavailable;
there is no caller-selectable template or density setting. Core accepts an
immutable, source-labelled snapshot, validates readiness and the selected
engineer identity, computes the figures once, and selects one of the four
outcomes. Infrastructure renders only that selection with the governed
template, stylesheet, logo, and signature resource.

The supplied assessment wording and the named engineer/signature evidence are
accepted only as exact matching tuples. The currently complete supplied tuple
is `A Patterson | M.Inst.IAEA | andy_patterson`; the Ed Mawdsley and Neil
O'Reilly signature images are governed assets, but no assessment may select
either until an accepted qualification completes that person's tuple. Missing,
unknown, mismatched, or substituted names, qualifications, keys, assets, source
versions, custody references, or required values fail closed. No custom
signature path, arbitrary local attachment path, placeholder, or wording absent
from the accepted evidence is permitted.

Generation returns draft assessment and fee-note artifacts with their bytes,
hashes, page counts, template version, and engine version. It is not approval,
issue, sending, external receipt, durable report-reference allocation, or
correction custody. Human approval remains required before issue; the durable
trigger, immutable reference/version and custody workflow is separately owned.

### Report-draft entry point

The renderer boundary above is reachable from one operator action (DELIV-012):
a "Generate report draft" control on the case Assessment screen
(`/Cases/{id}/Assessment`), open to the same staff roles as the rest of that
screen (Administrator, Engineer, User). It projects the case's already-saved,
confirmed assessment record into the accepted snapshot, renders it, and
creates or replays one immutable draft report version and returns the
assessment PDF to the operator's browser. The version retains the accepted
snapshot hash, template identity, source provenance, and the assessment/fee-note
artifact pair. It is not approved, issued, sent, or received by this action;
approval and issue remain the separately owned human acts described below.

**Readiness.** A single readiness rail decides whether the control is enabled:
`AssessmentPolicy.EvaluateReadiness` (the same list rendered elsewhere on the
Assessment screen) plus the few report-specific requirements the accepted
snapshot adds beyond the assessment record — a confirmed claimant, your
reference, an addressee, an incident date, a recognized inspection method, an
accepted engineer signature tuple, at least one custody-confirmed photograph
and source document, and repair-cost figures (below). A case that does not
meet every requirement leaves the control disabled and states each
outstanding reason by name; nothing is guessed to make the control available.

**Photographs and source evidence.** `Photos` are the case's custody-confirmed
`Image`-role documents (current, not logically removed, custody status
Confirmed) — the same confirmation gate the EVA hand-off bundle already uses
for its own image evidence. `Sources` are every other custody-confirmed case
document, reported by its own file name, version and hash, plus the selected
accepted repair-estimate source. Both are real custody facts, not curated: the Assessment screen's photograph
curation/ordering control is separately deferred (UI-15), so every confirmed
image on the case is offered.

**Repair-cost figures are imported, not derived by Pegasus.** A selected
accepted repair estimate may come from a connected estimating system or an
imported estimate document. Its calculation basis and source/version/hash are
copied into the accepted report snapshot. Multiple estimates remain separate
and the operator explicitly selects the one used for generation; no internal
rate-card formula or cross-estimate precedence is invented. A missing,
unaccepted, or ambiguous selected estimate keeps "Repair cost figures" as a
named readiness blocker.

### Report correction, finality, and post-report work

**Accepted report boundary:** an issued report has an immutable artifact/version identity and hash. A
correction or addendum creates a new reasoned version and retains every earlier
artifact, accepted fact, actor, time, and source; it never silently overwrites
the issued report. A closed case must be reasonedly reopened before its report
or evidence is revised.

The report-sent business event is the exact approved-mailbox Sent-item evidence
specified in [FRD-08 § Outbound correspondence evidence](frd-08-email-mailbox-and-background-processing.md#outbound-correspondence-evidence)
and remains final if Outlook later moves or deletes the item.
Outlook `sentDateTime` remains the business time; discovery and link times are
not substitutes. Report sent enters post-report work rather than closing the
case. A Box report PDF, file upload, generated artifact, draft, queue result, or
staff assertion alone proves neither sending nor external receipt.

Post-report queries, disputes, amendment requests, and replies remain
case-owned correspondence with source/reply-chain identity and permanent
history. Collision Engineers' Engineer responds to them, but the exact
CASE-23 states, transitions, correction/reopen interaction, due/chaser
interaction, and closure rules remain `Next`/unallocated and unresolved; no
mailbox adapter may invent them or create a new case/reference. See [external
data, submission, and report
contracts](../open-decisions.md#external-data-submission-and-report-contracts).

Requirements:

- deterministic template and payload versioning;
- preserved document/source provenance;
- authorised human review and approval of report facts and content before
  issue, without inventing a separate case-lifecycle pre-send review gate;
- immutable issued artifact identity and hash;
- correction/addendum rather than silent overwrite;
- exact delivery evidence where the workflow requires it;
- accessible staff presentation of status, validation, and failure without
  implying an unproved external delivery.

### Targeted sending and reviewed AI proposals

An allocated targeted report-send transaction is idempotent and records
approved destinations, immutable artifact/version, Box filing, exact send
evidence, completion outcome, and partial-failure recovery. A correction does
not silently alter an issued fee note or invoice; later financial impact uses
its own versioned, authorised contract. Staff-selected AI Assessor and
Engineer-reviewed query proposals remain proposals until the authorised human
accepts or rejects them through Core.

The vendor-neutral `Send to AI` work transport (AI-09; reworded by ADR-0021
under the operator's 2026-08-03 direct-write decision) hands a scoped worker
a pointer to one case — never case content — and the worker returns its work
as ordinary Automation Actor writes through the same Core commands, edit
lease, operation-key replay, and version guards as a staff save, attributed
and permanently recorded with the same rigor as any human action. Values the
automation records are unconfirmed working data reviewed by the engineer the
case is manually assigned to. Confirming a professional finding is
staff-Engineer-only, and report approval and outward dispatch remain human
acts, so no model, skill, prompt, or external source ever issues an accepted
case, engineering, economic, legal, or report outcome.

Durable Send to AI work has stable request, hand-off, reply, and disposition
identities. Stale work cannot overwrite a newer case/evidence version;
duplicate, expired, or cancelled requests are idempotent or inert outcomes of
the tracking record that never mutate accepted data; no AI caller confirms,
approves, or sends autonomously.

Signatures embedded in governed renderer documents are provenance-sensitive
document assets, not Web decorative imagery.
